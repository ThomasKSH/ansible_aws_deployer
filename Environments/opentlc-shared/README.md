In this directory, we create folders, yml files, and other items
we want to over ride default variables.

For example, we will include things such as ec2 instance names, secret
variables such as private/public key pair information, passwords, etc.

Eventually, all sensitive information will be encypted via Ansible Vault. The
inclusion as well as instructions on doing this will be included in a later
release.
